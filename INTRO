undURnet
#####################################
Unix non-central synchronic network
All inter-node access only by direct encrypted tunnels P2P

Each machine is a FreeBSD node connected directly to peers via pre-shared-encryption
Each machine has its own route of nodes to which its users are able to obtain a direct connection

Services offered: 
Massive Data Access, secure terminals, code-workbench, proxy, data-encryption, subnet-gate, WiFi gate, website, mail, chat, game ...

OVERVIEW
	undURnet offers a stable & secure network framework built for usage: global or standalone
  Non-central control allows maximum adoption critical to ease a hopeful mass-return to the Terminal
  
	A low budget cost model is inherent by design
  Empower an old computer into a 1337-modded workstation
  
  Requisite Material:
    Manual + USB + keys
  
  To get started all required is the Manual, bootable USB, and access keys to other nodes
  User will boot the USB on a common AMD64 machine into a temporary-live-kernel or permenant install	
    
ANTI-SURVIELLENT TECHNOLOGY	
  Anti-Surveillent technology is critical to retain right of privacy
  undURnet uses both encryption & obfuscation to guard private activity
  
	Mr. Comely, the fired FBI director, set an Agency objective to make encryption illegal [i]. 

  Our Internet Service Providers have been given monitoring power over all networks
  Data host platforms are monopolized govt-agents which store your data making you forever liable to prosecution

DATA-SCENE
  IRC & topsites, pirates, were about mastering esoteric methods
  Relationships built by who you knew & trusted
  Access to a topsite was proof of legitimacy 
  Yet topsites consolidated hacker booty
  Files available were dependent upon collection of members
  topsites became a govt target and due to the design-flaws allowed members to be hunted down
  
  Torrents killed the pirate scene due to three prominent factors 
    Entry into Torrents required a minimum-skill-set
    Search-index-system consolidated each booty to be available to all = searchable files
    Data-packet-method allowed superior data-handling in that world of low-bandwidth
  Torrent traffic is entirely public & prosecutable to those who both host & leech-data
  
  Streaming sites set skill-of-entry to be non-existent
  Files were searchable & the access was immediate (unlike all other methods)
  Similar to topsites, the files available depended on the hosts
  Streaming sites are govt-targets but leechers were immune to prosecution

PROMISE
  undURnet is built by a unix master craftsman
  All implementations are battle tested
  All guarantees are personal

CREATOR
  Pirate since IRC & topsites as a data-ripper & encoder & bot-file-serve scripter
  Contributions made to the scene were significant in a small yet critical way
  Member of many scenes of the two decades & tireless climb to 1337 in unix/pirate methods

  undURnet is a product of operator-immunity from govt-prosecution
  
  Critical factors of privacy
    machine-verification, traffic & data-storage obfuscation, trust model
    
  I call for a return to the original scene of Piracy: the unix terminal
  High-skill-set to prove one worthy of entry barring no-scrub-trash

STABILITY & SECURITY
  Stability & security is the goal of the unix operating system kernel 
  Network communication was built in the unix enviornment & will remain most stable at home
  
  FreeBSD is the operating system built by academic & theoretic rigor
  The code is open, the kernel highly-customizable, and reputation legendary
  undURnet only operates in the FreeBSD Kernel
  
KERNEL
  FreeBSD has a monolithic kernel which allows for several states of operation
  	Stable: never power-down
  	Portable: secure accesss in secure & insecure enviornment
  	Subnet gate: hide from snoopage all devices connected via ehternet & WiFi
  	Transient No-Trace: boot live act, wipe-imprint, powerdown leaves computer back to normal state
  	MITM: snoop all outgoing traffic from a computer entirely invisible
  	Device: usb wipers, key exchangers, data exchangers, bootable-cloners

TERMINAL
  The user interface to the Kernel is the Terminal as called the Shell
  undURnet enviornments are homogeneous
  If a user masters any enviornment, it directly masters all enviornments

PERIODIC & REP
  undURnet is synchornized & periodic
  After each period, DAY, the value of each node is calculated into REP
  
  REP improves access-key trade-rate on the NET
  REP is verified & sychronized by git-protocol
  
  Many measureable factors value a machine onto the network
  Age on the net, services offered, data-storage, reputation, ....
  This value is then monetized in the form of access keys

KEYS
  Each access key is one-time-only which retains a supply & demand 
  Access keys are the currency of undURnet
  
  The higher value of a node translates into higher value of all available access keys
  Period duration keeps a stable state in which each machine knows value of all machines
  This allows for an intelligent market
  
  Access keys can be dumped onto a USB and sold for money
  Users are able to invest in machines & skills and are able to reap all-rewards
  
CLAN
  Each node is able to operate under a group of users called a CLAN
  A CLAN may have one or many users. A user may have many CLAN
  
  Flow of REP
  REP > machine > CLAN
  
  Each DAY, each machine is calculated independently via logs
  Machine value is then aggregated by CLAN
  Example:
  1 = node_A + node_B + node_C : 1 = .5 + .2 +.3
  clancat = node_A + node_C = .8
  All clancat node access keys now are traded at the ratio of .8 for the next period
  All owners of access keys, maintained by clancat, now are benefited by a ratio of .8
  
  CLAN gains REP and all owners of CLAN access-keys gain in their investment
  
  Some ways to gain REP
    asset: host-machine, bandwidth, local-net, data-drives
    service: file-scrape, log-watch, access-key-exchange, protocol-server
  
  CLAN growth is a material growth of current market value of all its node access keys
  There is no royal-road or cheat-gimmick 
  All CLANS operate on equal conditions is vital to decentralization

SICC
  System In Complete Chaos is the massive data network file management
  Data is scraped from external sources and then standardized & stored as file slices at many locations
  Data stored as file slices obfuscates identity and isolates operator from data hosted
  The host does not have all the slices of files only parts
  
  File slices and meta-data are isolated
  The location of data slice ignorant to each slices: type, name, list of files, source

CENSUS
  File parts are stored in a database which ties the slice to all known-locations
  This allows for explicit-duplication creating the netwide-efficency of storage
  
  file disgest: location 1, location 2, ..., location N
  
META
  The original scraper or librarian build databases
  	Slice sequence to build a file
	Encryption password to each slice
	File type, name, category, size, creator
  This set up allows undURnet to be flexible according to current state
  Non-persecuted allows for freely-shared indexing of plain-files
  Persecuted enviornment allows for private indexing of encrypted-files
  
  If META is exposed all file slices are known
  CLAN reputation safeguards this most-critical-resource of the undURnet
  
FILE
  undURnet allows for an unlimited amount of data consolidated or segregate
  The searchableness of the network data is relative to the enviornment
  Host operator serving data-slices is noncupable to its set of piecemeal contents
  
  Flexibility & Privacy will foster an enviornment for voracious trading activity
  undURnet currently hosts one of the most diverse booty archives
  
  File exchange is a prominent portion of the demand for access to undURnet
  
  SCRAPER
  	user inserts a USB and scrapes the data
	recieves the CENSUS & META data
	uploads the META data to CLAN
	uploads the META to a index-server
	
  LEECH
  	user logs into an index-server
	searches for file type
	selects a file name
	recieves file-slice-sequence, decryption-password-sequence
	from META is able to link slices to location
	using the information is able to download all slices & build file

WEAKNESS
  The masses prefer the lowest cost of entry and so does the government
  High cost of entry into the undURnet is a rite of passage
  Only after great difficulty is the gui-monkey convinced to walk as man
  To fight against the global-squash of privacy
  
  Methods to assist entry
    undURnet Manual: Theory & Implementation
    Website FAQ, links, chat help
    Howto video walk-thru
    In-person exposition of methods
    
MARKET
  IRC & topsites are dead. Torrents aren't thriving. Streaming sites operate by toxic-business.
  Global masses flood the design which requires the least intellectual commitment
  Naturally there exists an anti-movement angst
  
  undURnet is the place for the elite & wannabe
  All methods to help educate users are of foremost consideration
  
  Methods of undURnet directly build unix skills
  What ability gained can be used on unix systems
  
  Image of users of the undURnet is its vital asset
  Esoteric legion of craftsman

COMPANY STANDARD
	undURnet endgame is to change the global shape of network activity from government-oversight to private
